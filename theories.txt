Declaration: is when you are declare a variable and you do not assign it to a value
Initialization: is when you declare a variable and assign a value to it.

Datatypes: define the kind of values that variables can hold.
Primitive Data types: represent single values and are immutable(they cannot be changed after creation)
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- undefined
- Null
- Symbol
- BigInt

Non-Primitive data types: these are objects and are mutable(can be changed after creation)
(they are stored by reference)
E.g: - Object: collections of key-value pairs
    - Array: are ordered collections of elements/indexed from 0(they can store multiple values of any type)
    - Function
    - Date

Summary Table:
Feature	       Array	                 Object
Structure	Ordered collection (list)	Key-value pairs (dictionary-like)
Access	By numeric index	            By key (property name)
Order	Maintains order of elements	    No guaranteed order of properties
Length/Size	Has length property	        No built-in length property
Use Case	Lists, ordered data	        Structured data, key-value pairs
Iteration	for, forEach(), map()	    for...in, Object.keys(), entries()
Mutability	Can add/remove/change elements	Can add/remove/change properties

Arrays are best for ordered collections of similar items, while objects are ideal for associating values with named keys.
